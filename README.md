# Persona - a prototype
_Identity based proof of trust distributed consensus platform._

### tdlr:
- what it's made of: a web of trust which reinforces and is reinforced by the permissioned consensus algorithm.
- what it relates to: it achieves distributed consensus with identity intrinsically baked into the platform itself.

### Pros:
- intrinsic identity
- fast transaction times
- highly scalable
- decentralized
### Cons:
- loss of anonymity

### Key Takeaway:
Persona is the answer to the question: what happens if the object upon which a distributed consensus network was coming into consensus on was exactly who was a valid and trustworthy actor within the network?

### Getting Involved:
Persona is still in the design phase.

### Getting Started:
Coming soon...
